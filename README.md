Imagine a world where you could freely lend those things that are sitting around your home to a good cause. And in return, you could receive compensation, or choose to donate this compensation to another person or group. This kind of world would have less waste from manufacturing less items, and increased community.

How would such a world work?

With traditional platforms like eBay, you can sell your items, but there is no mechanism to lend your items for a period of time. Obviously, you take on the risk of someone not paying for your item, or for not returning your item in good working condition. These concerns are mitigated by having a decentralized exchange with transparency about lender/lendee, renter's insurance for undelivered/damaged items. Wherever possible, these insurances are returned back to the user in order to keep the transaction costs low enough that the marketplace is operational/safe, but with razer-thin mark-ups. 

In general, the process :

1. Verified user will request item at fixed price
2. When contract is entered at agreed up-on price, dates, terms & conditions and built into blockchain
3. Seller will scan confirmation of QR outbound code into blockchain while shipping
4. When item is returned, Seller will scan QR code and attach to blockchain

Adjudication - if there is a conflict, both parties can post versions of history/photos, and a group of peers will vote on the blockchain to determine the outcome.
